an intelligent dialog robot

This project represents one of my belief:
An intellgent adult spends over 10 years developing his brain biologocally since he's in the womb and over 20 years to learn how to think and talk reasonably. We shouldn't assume human-like intelligence is easy to create unsupervised.


Different from trending learning approaches, I'll try to *hard-code* an intelligent robot. I believe strongly it's possible to teach a program logical thinking and even human feelings just by hard-coded subroutines.
